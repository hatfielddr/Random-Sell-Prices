# Random Sell Prices
Simple mod for Lethal Company that randomizes selling prices each day. Fully Configurable. Both **Host** and **Clients** need this mod to see the changes.

## Default options
Minimum Price: 10%\
Maximum Price: 120%\
Pity Day Enabled: true\
Pity Price: 80%

Days are completely randomized, however _at least_ one day per quota period will have at least the Pity Price (if enabled) to ensure it's still somewhat balanced if you get bad rolls.
