# Random Sell Prices
Simple mod for Lethal Company that randomizes selling prices each day. Fully Configurable and Host Only

## Default options
	Minimum Price: 10%
	Maximum Price: 120%
	Pity Price: 80%

	Days are completely randomized, however _at least_ one day per quota period will have at least the Pity Price to ensure it's still somewhat balanced if you get bad rolls
